# Python_Clustering_Project
In this data analysis project we perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers using Python. We identify the best possible cluster using KMeans machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate and multivariate clusters. Once these clusters are identified, we performed summary statistics on these to identify the best marketing group.
